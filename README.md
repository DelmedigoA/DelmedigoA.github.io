## Projects
### Text Segmentation and Formatting using LSTM Neural Networks
[SpaceGen](https://huggingface.co/spaces/asafd60/SpaceGen?logs=container)

Implemented an LSTM-based model for word segmentation in unstructured text as part of an academic project. The model effectively identifies boundaries within continuous text sequences, transforming strings like "thisisatext" into "this is a text.", using advaanced sequence modeling, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

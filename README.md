## Education

- M.Sc, Neuroscience, Data Science track | The Gonda Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center, Bar-Ilan (_In-Progress_)
- B.A., Psychology | The Hebrew University of Jerusalem (_Feb 2022_)

## Work Experience

**Head of Branch | Central Bureau of Statistics, Jerusalem (_August 2022 - Present_)**

- Developed and fine-tuned multi-modal models for computer vision tasks, specifically document-based question answering (QA) and classification, using TensorFlow and Hugging Face Transformers

- Developed and deployed a tabular classification machine learning model. Subsequently, I was responsible for constructing and managing a substantial, sensitive dataset utilizing the modelâ€™s outputs.

- Extract valuable information from databases and provide meaningful insights for decision-making, using complex SQL queries
  
- Responsible for assessing and supervising survey takers' performance data to enhance surveying validity and efficiency as part of Israel's OECD's Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC)

- Developed and deployed a web scraping solution to automate information extraction from websites to enhance operational efficiency

## Projects

### Text Segmentation and Formatting using LSTM Neural Networks

Implemented SpaceGen, an LSTM-based model for word segmentation in unstructured text as part of an academic project. The model effectively identifies boundaries within continuous text sequences, transforming strings like "thisisatext" into "this is a text.", using advanced sequence modeling, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
